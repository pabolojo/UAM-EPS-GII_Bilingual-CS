To use the makefile correctly and execute the programs, the following steps must be followed:
1. make
2. ./example<num_example> ex<num_example>.asm
3. make ex<num_example>
4. ./ex<num_example>

Where "num_example" corresponds to the example number we are executing (1, 2, ... , 7).
Step 2 is for running the C program, while 3 and 4 are to link and compile, and run the asm program respectively.
