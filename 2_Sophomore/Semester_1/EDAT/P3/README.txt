WHAT YOU MUST DO:

In the directory development/src you will find the files table.h, table.c, index.h, index.c. 
These are the files you must work on. Implement the functions that have been left blank in 
table.c and index.c

The command 
    make all
will create the executable test in the directory install. This is the executable that you will
use to test your program. You can create text files (use test.txt as a model) and store them 
in tables.
